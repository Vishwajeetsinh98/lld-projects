The requirements for the meeting scheduler design problem are defined below:

- **R1:** The system must support a configurable number of meeting rooms, allowing organizations to add or manage rooms as needed.
- **R2:** Each meeting room must have a defined capacity, ensuring only meetings within the room’s limits can be scheduled.
- **R3:** Meeting rooms can be booked for specific time intervals, provided they are available and not already reserved for overlapping times.
- **R4:** When a meeting is scheduled, updated, or canceled, notifications must be sent promptly to all invited participants.
- **R5:** Invited participants receive meeting invites regardless of their current availability. The system must track each participant’s invitation response status (accepted, declined, pending) within the meeting record.
- **R6:** Every user must have access to a personal calendar to view, schedule, or cancel meetings, and to track all meeting invitations and responses.
- **R7:** The organizer must be able to add or remove participants after a meeting has been scheduled, and appropriate notifications must be sent for any changes.
- **R8:** The system must handle booking conflicts and overlapping meetings, providing clear feedback if a room or participant is booked for the requested time.
- **R9:** The organizer should be able to edit meeting details (such as title, agenda, room, time, and participant list), and all updates should trigger notifications.
- **R10:** The system should support cancellation of meetings by the organizer or authorized participants, notifying all invitees of the cancellation.
- **R11:** If a participant declines an invite or withdraws from a meeting, the meeting must be removed from their calendar, and their response status updated in the meeting record. The meeting should remain active for other participants unless canceled by the organizer.
- **R12:** Any updates to a meeting (e.g., time, room, or participants) should automatically update all relevant calendars and trigger notifications.
