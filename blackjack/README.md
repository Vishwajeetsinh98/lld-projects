- R1: The system must support a shoe containing one or more standard decks of cards.
- **R2:** Each deck consists of 52 cards in four suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades), each containing 13 ranks: Ace, 2–10, Jack, Queen, and King.
- **R3:** Every card has a specific point value:  

| Card | Face Value |
|----- | ---------- |
| Ace | 1 or 11 |
| From 2 to 10 | Equals the card number |
| Face cards (King, Queen, and Jack) | 10 |

- **R4:** The game has two user roles: the Player and the Dealer.
- **R5:** Each player must place a bet at the start of every round.
- **R6:** At the start of each game round, the dealer deals two cards to each player and two to themselves.
- **R7:** Both player cards are dealt face-up; the dealer’s first card is face-up, and the second is face-down.
- **R8:** Players may hit (draw an additional card) if their hand total is less than 21 points.
- **R9:** According to standard Blackjack rules, the dealer must hit if their hand value is less than 17 points.
- **R10:** If a player’s or dealer’s hand exceeds 21 points, they bust and immediately lose that round.
- **R11:** Players may stand (decline to take more cards) at any time during their turn.
- **R12:** At the end of the round, if a player’s hand total is higher than the dealer’s and does not exceed 21, the player wins and receives a payout equal to their bet (1:1).
- **R13:** If a player achieves a Blackjack (Ace and a 10-point card as their initial two cards), they receive a payout of 3:2 (150% of their bet).
- **R14:** If the player and dealer have the same point total at the end of a round, it is a push; the player gets their original bet back, or may be offered a replay.
- **R15:** If a player leaves or disconnects before the end of a round, the dealer automatically wins that round.
