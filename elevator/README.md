### For the elevator design problem, the requirements are defined below: 
- **R1:** The elevator car system shall support a configurable number of floors (up to 15) and a configurable number of elevator cars (up to 3).
- **R2:** Each elevator car shall be capable of serving every floor and exist in one of four states: moving up, moving down, maintenance, or idle.
- **R3:** Elevator doors shall only open when the car is idle and auto-close after a configurable timeout unless the “Open” button is actively held.
- **R4:** Each floor shall have a panel with Up/Down call buttons, indicator lights, and an external display of the car’s current floor and direction.
- **R5:** Each elevator car shall have buttons, ground (0) to 15th floor, for every floor, “Open,” “Close,” and an emergency-stop button, plus an internal display showing the current floor, direction, and load status.
- **R6:** Pressing the emergency-stop button shall immediately halt the car, keep doors closed, and alert building security/operators.
- **R7:** Each elevator car shall enforce a maximum load of 680 kg, inhibit motion if this limit is exceeded, and emit an audible and visual alarm when overloaded.
- **R8:** The central controller shall assign the most appropriate car to each floor-call request, aiming to minimize average wait time, and command that car to move accordingly.
- **R9:** The elevator car system shall support calls from multiple passengers, with each passenger able to go to the same or different floors in the same or opposite direction.
- **R10:** The system shall support a maintenance state for each car in which:
  - **R10a:** The car is removed from normal dispatch (no new requests assigned).
  - **R10b:** All elevator doors remain closed, and panel inputs are ignored.
  - **R10c:** All UIs display “Maintenance” for that car.
  - **R10d:** Upon exiting maintenance, the car returns to idle state at its current floor before resuming service.
- **R11:** All internal and external displays and indicators shall update in real time to reflect each elevator car’s current floor, direction, and operational state (idle, moving, maintenance, or emergency).
- **R12:** The system shall communicate all operational states, errors, and safety messages to users via audio/visual indicators and displays, ensuring passengers are always aware of the elevator’s status.
